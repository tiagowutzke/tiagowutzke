#### About me

In my professional career, I always try to prioritize a position that provides me with personal and professional growth, and it was in the career of data analyst that I found the best of this reality.

Communicating results with data and sharing experiences with co-workers help me to improve my soft skills. Applying knowledge for data processing (data wrangling) and performing EDA (exploratory data analysis) motivate me for what I like to do most: make deliveries that provide value to the areas interested in my work with data.

#### Skills

Some skills I have are: 

- Python
- SQL
- Google spreadsheets
